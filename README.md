This is my second game developed in Pygame. (I followed a tutorial by ClearCode, however I've been working on expanding the game)

I'm packaging the application as an APK file with Pygbag, so all my code files have to be in the same directory or Pygbag does not seem to recognise them and turn them into bytecode. 
This make the structure pretty messy, but I haven't found a fix for it just yet.
